# AI-Based HoneyPot System

A sophisticated honeypot system leveraging artificial intelligence for threat detection, analysis, and reporting. This system provides real-time monitoring of potential attacks and generates actionable security insights.

## Features

- **Multiple Honeypot Types**: SSH and Web honeypots with expandable architecture
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Real-time analysis of attack patterns and threat intelligence generation
- **Modern Dashboard**: Interactive web interface for monitoring and management
- **Threat Classification**: Automatic categorization of attacks by type and severity
- **Security Recommendations**: AI-generated security recommendations

## System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Backend API Server**: FastAPI-based server that manages honeypots and provides APIs
2. **Honeypot Services**: Simulated vulnerable services that attract and monitor attackers
3. **Frontend Dashboard**: React-based UI for visualization and management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Running the System

1. Start the backend server:

```bash
python server.py
```

2. Start the frontend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

3. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`

## Honeypot Types

### SSH Honeypot

Simulates an SSH server and captures login attempts. Detects:
- Brute force attacks
- Command injection attempts
- Unusual client connections

### Web Honeypot

Simulates a vulnerable web server. Detects:
- SQL injection attempts
- Path traversal attacks
- XSS attempts
- Vulnerability scans

## AI Analysis Features

The system uses various AI techniques to analyze attacks:

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual attack patterns
- **Attack Classification**: Categorizes attacks based on signatures and behavior
- **Threat Scoring**: Assigns severity levels to detected threats
- **Attacker Profiling**: Builds profiles of repeated attackers
- **Security Recommendations**: Generates actionable security advice

## Dashboard Features

- **Alert Dashboard**: Real-time display of detected attacks
- **Honeypot Management**: Interface to deploy, configure and monitor honeypots
- **Threat Intelligence**: Visualizations of attack trends and statistics
- **Security Reports**: Detailed reports on detected threats

## Security Considerations

This system is designed for research and monitoring purposes. When deploying:

- Use non-privileged ports for development/testing
- Deploy in an isolated network environment
- Do not expose honeypots to the internet without proper security controls
- Follow all applicable laws and regulations regarding security monitoring

## Extending the System

The modular architecture allows easy extension:

- Add new honeypot types by extending the `BaseHoneypot` class
- Enhance AI analysis by modifying the `AIAnalyzer` class
- Add new dashboard components to visualize specific data
